Furthermore, due to the contributions of spectator protons, we observed poor centrality resolution when using charged particles at forward η regions at low energies. Centrality resolutions are decreases towards peripheral collisions.","tags":null,"title":"Effect of centrality selection on higher-order cumulants of net-proton multiplicity distributions in relativistic heavy-ion collisions","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1573713014,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573713014,"objectID":"42eb86902d4051718efb3bd0c7778a6d","permalink":"https://arghyanit.github.io/talk/hibr-2019/","publishdate":"2019-11-14T16:13:14+05:30","relpermalink":"/talk/hibr-2019/","section":"talk","summary":"Talk at **QCD Phase Structure Workshop**","tags":[],"title":"Off-diagonal cumulants of net-particle multiplicity distributions in Au+Au collisions and effect of centrality selection on net-proton cumulant analysis","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572865224,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572865224,"objectID":"ec5b2614bad7d4bb651831493eaa41c7","permalink":"https://arghyanit.github.io/talk/qm-2019/","publishdate":"2019-11-04T16:30:24+05:30","relpermalink":"/talk/qm-2019/","section":"talk","summary":"Poster at **QM2019**","tags":[],"title":"The STAR measurements on off-diagonal cumulants of net-particle multiplicity distributions in Au+Au collisions at $/^{-}s_{NN}$ = 7.7-200 GeV","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1566190800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566190800,"objectID":"143bcb836cbb16fc813be06c626da624","permalink":"https://arghyanit.github.io/talk/qpt-2019/","publishdate":"2020-08-14T20:30:00+05:30","relpermalink":"/talk/qpt-2019/","section":"talk","summary":"Talk at **QPT 2019**","tags":[],"title":"Second-order Off-diagonal cumulants of net-proton, net-kaon and net-charge multiplicity distributions at RHIC","type":"talk"},{"authors":["J.

The results are compared with calculations from UrQMD, AMPT, and EPOS event generators, and estimations of kT are made for Pb–Pb collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. A hadron resonance gas (HRG) model has been used to calculate kT as a function of collision energy. Our results show a decrease in kT at low collision energies to sNN∼20 GeV , beyond which the kT values remain almost constant.","tags":null,"title":"Isothermal compressibility of hadronic matter formed in relativistic nuclear collisions","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1480928449,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1480928449,"objectID":"67b9466eee697127b97fcdb8eaa6424a","permalink":"https://arghyanit.github.io/talk/dae-2016/","publishdate":"2016-12-05T14:30:49+05:30","relpermalink":"/talk/dae-2016/","section":"talk","summary":"Talk at **DAE-BRNS Symposium 2016**","tags":[],"title":"Susceptibilities of conserved quantities in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Arghya Chatterjee","Sandeep Chatterjee","Tapan K.
