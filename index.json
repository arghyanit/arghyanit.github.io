Furthermore, due to the contributions of spectator protons, we observed poor centrality resolution when using charged particles at forward η regions at low energies. Centrality resolutions are decreases towards peripheral collisions.","tags":null,"title":"Effect of centrality selection on higher-order cumulants of net-proton multiplicity distributions in
